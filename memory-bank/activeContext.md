# Active Context — lib-foundation

## Current State: `feat/v0.4.3` (as of 2026-07-07)

**[ ] SPEC READY — assigned to Codex (2026-07-07) — ACG session check false-negatives on a slow-rendering sandbox page:** `docs/bugs/2026-07-07-acg-session-check-render-race-false-negative.md`, branch `feat/v0.4.3`. Diagnosed live from a `CLUSTER_PROVIDER=k3s-aws make up` run that reused an already-signed-in CDP browser yet still prompted `ACTION REQUIRED: Please log into Pluralsight`. Tab 0 was already at `SANDBOX_URL` and logged in; probing the six `LOGGED_IN_SELECTORS` moments later showed `Cloud Sandboxes`/`Open Sandbox` VISIBLE — so selectors + session are fine. Root cause = render-timing race: `acg_session_check.js` navigates with `waitUntil:'domcontentloaded'` (fires before the SPA paints), swallows nav failure with `.catch(()=>{})`, then runs the **single-shot** `pageLooksLoggedIn` (1.5s/selector, no retry) → all six miss on a not-yet-painted page → false logged-out. Creds unset so headless auto-login was skipped → dropped to manual prompt. Fix (3 files): `pageLooksLoggedIn` gains a backward-compatible `{attempts,perSelectorTimeoutMs,settleMs}` retry loop; `acg_session_check.js` waits for `networkidle` + retries the initial probe with `{attempts:4}` and logs (not swallows) nav failure; jest regression test proves single-shot misses a slow render and retry detects it. NO selector or credential-gating changes. Commit msg: `fix(acg): retry logged-in detection to stop session-check render-race false negative`. Gates: `node --check scripts/lib/acg/acg_session_check.js` (NOT covered by `npm run check`), `npm run check`, `npm test`. Relates to [[feedback_lib_acg_subtree_discipline]], [[feedback_lib_edits_upstream_first]].

**v0.4.2 SHIPPED — PR #34 merged to main (`ae9fc73`, 2026-07-06).** ACG headless CDP auto-login + stale-browser reclaim/reuse (BUG #1–#5). Post-merge done: main synced, **TAGGED v0.4.2** (annotated tag at merge `ae9fc73`; GitHub release published, targetCommitish main, not draft/prerelease), CHANGE.md stamped `## [v0.4.2] — 2026-07-06` (`0ce4d0b`), `feat/v0.4.3` cut from main, retro `docs/retro/2026-07-06-v0.4.2-retrospective.md` written. No branch protection on main → no enforce_admins to restore. Standing docs: `copilot-instructions.md` current (acg already covered), acg API lives in `docs/api/acg.md` (no new public shell functions — `_cdp_connectable`/`_cdp_kill_port_listener` are `_`-private), `projectbrief.md` n/a for lib-foundation. **Downstream: k3d-manager subtree-pulled v0.4.2** into `scripts/lib/foundation/` (merge `c116e655`, split `b6141505`, 14 files under prefix; cdp.sh verified diff-identical to upstream, `bash -n` clean). Two process rules from the milestone (retro): run default-severity shellcheck before push (CI catches `info`-level SC2016 that local `-S warning` hides); update `acg_cdp.bats` in the same commit as any `_browser_launch`/CDP behavior change. **Follow-up still open:** `gcp_login.js:157` latent no-op `disconnect()` → replace with `close()` in a separate change. Relates to [[feedback_lib_acg_subtree_discipline]], [[feedback_lib_edits_upstream_first]].

**PR #34 — v0.4.2 ACG headless-gate line (BUG #1–#5), merged (2026-07-06):** https://github.com/wilddog64/lib-foundation/pull/34, `feat/v0.4.2` → `main`, head `9be232a`, merge `ae9fc73`. **Operator ran the live acceptance gate — `make credential-test PROVIDER=aws` works headlessly (user-confirmed).** CI first ran the `acg_cdp.bats` + shellcheck jobs on this PR and surfaced accumulated debt across the whole line: (1) two `_browser_launch` BATS tests had drifted (test 2 broke at BUG #3's managed-Chromium launch, test 1 at BUG #5's `_cdp_connectable` gate) — fixed test-only in **`d9ff95e`** (mock `_cdp_connectable`, stub `node`, drop dead `open` mock, + new reclaim/relaunch-branch test); (2) CI shellcheck runs at default severity and flagged SC2016 (info) on the `_cdp_connectable` node `-e` template literal — added a `# shellcheck disable=SC2016` directive; also reworded the Unreleased CHANGE.md bullet that still described BUG #4's superseded profile-identity hard-reject — both in **`9be232a`**. **CI green on `9be232a`.** Copilot round: 6 findings — 4 fixed (3 test-drift → `d9ff95e`, 1 changelog → `9be232a`), 2 declined-with-rationale (node validation already handled by the empty-`_pw_chrome_bin` `_err`; `lsof`-unavailable is unreachable on the macOS-only launch path); all 6 threads resolved. `main` has no branch protection → no `enforce_admins` to disable. **Next: user merges PR #34 → tag v0.4.2 → subtree-pull into k3d-manager → confirm `CLUSTER_PROVIDER=k3s-aws make up`.** Relates to [[feedback_lib_acg_subtree_discipline]], [[feedback_lib_edits_upstream_first]].

**BUG #5 COMPLETE (Codex, 2026-07-06) — reuse a healthy CDP browser; reclaim a stale/zombie one instead of erroring:** `docs/bugs/2026-07-06-cdp-reclaim-unhealthy-browser-instead-of-error.md`, branch `feat/v0.4.2`. Root cause after BUG #4 was NOT version drift: the same managed CFT binary/version (`Chrome/148.0.7778.96`, `chromium-1223`, Playwright 1.60.0) on the same `pw-profile` failed `connectOverCDP` as a lingering zombie process but succeeded when freshly launched. BUG #4's profile-identity guard therefore used the wrong signal: it adopted an undriveable zombie when the profile matched, and hard-errored on a foreign listener instead of reclaiming the port. **Implemented as `db5b8e23dc2f33ea6a2be36636266cec03806a70`** (`fix(acg): reclaim stale CDP browser and reuse healthy one instead of erroring`), pushed to `origin/feat/v0.4.2`. Scope held to the 2 listed files: `scripts/lib/acg/cdp.sh` now adds `_cdp_connectable` (Playwright `connectOverCDP` connect+close health probe) and `_cdp_kill_port_listener` (`lsof -t` TERM→KILL reclaim), and rewrites `_browser_launch` to reuse an existing `:9222` browser only when Playwright can actually drive it, otherwise reclaim the port and fall through to the existing managed-Chromium relaunch path; `CHANGE.md` `[Unreleased]` gained the required `### Fixed` entry. `_cdp_profile_in_use` remains defined and is still used by the agent-stop and singleton-lock helpers, but `_browser_launch` no longer hard-`_err`s on the reuse path. Gates passed: `shellcheck -S warning scripts/lib/acg/cdp.sh`, `npm run check`, `npm test`, and sourcing probe `bash -c 'source scripts/lib/acg/cdp.sh; declare -f _browser_launch _cdp_connectable _cdp_kill_port_listener >/dev/null'`. **USER acceptance remains operator-run only:** with a healthy managed browser on `:9222`, `make credential-test PROVIDER=aws` must reuse it; with a stale or zombie listener on `:9222`, it must reclaim the port, relaunch managed CFT, and continue without a manual `kill`. Relates to [[feedback_lib_acg_subtree_discipline]], [[feedback_lib_edits_upstream_first]].

**BUG #4 COMPLETE (Codex, 2026-07-06) — credential-test now launches the managed browser and `_browser_launch` rejects a foreign CDP browser:** `docs/bugs/2026-07-06-credential-test-launch-and-browser-identity-guard.md`, branch `feat/v0.4.2`. Root cause was the two residual gaps after `e136f55`: (A) `_browser_launch` (cdp.sh:72–75) adopted ANY browser already on `:9222` without checking identity, so a stale system Chrome 150 on the old `profile` dir could be adopted and reintroduce CDP drift; (B) `bin/acg-credential-test` never called `_browser_launch` at all — after `36c3bb1` it curl-guarded `:9222` then only `_cdp_ensure_acg_session` (connect-only, never launches), so the managed-Chromium launch path was unreachable from `make credential-test`. **Implemented as `2918d5c0d818b73ebdde6ba3a5c18a12af604c10`** (`fix(acg): route credential-test through _browser_launch and guard CDP browser identity`), pushed to `origin/feat/v0.4.2`. Scope held to the 3 listed files: `scripts/lib/acg/cdp.sh` now hoists `_cdp_profile_dir` and rejects an existing `:9222` listener unless `_cdp_profile_in_use` confirms the Playwright-managed `pw-profile`; `scripts/lib/acg/bin/acg-credential-test` now sources `cdp.sh` and calls `_browser_launch`, removing the stale `open -a "Google Chrome"` guidance and restoring the managed-browser self-launch path; `CHANGE.md` `[Unreleased]` gained the required `### Fixed` entry. Gates passed: `shellcheck -S warning scripts/lib/acg/cdp.sh scripts/lib/acg/bin/acg-credential-test`, `npm run check`, `npm test`, and sourcing probe `bash -c 'source scripts/lib/acg/cdp.sh; declare -f _browser_launch >/dev/null'`. **USER acceptance remains operator-run only:** with `:9222` free, `make credential-test PROVIDER=aws` must launch Chrome-for-Testing, sign in headlessly, and extract creds; with a foreign Chrome on `:9222`, it must fail fast with the new guard message. Relates to [[feedback_lib_acg_subtree_discipline]], [[feedback_lib_edits_upstream_first]].

**BUG #3 COMPLETE (Codex, 2026-07-06) — CDP now launches Playwright-managed Chromium, not system Chrome:** `docs/bugs/2026-07-06-cdp-use-playwright-managed-chromium.md`, branch `feat/v0.4.2`. **Root cause (diagnosed live this session):** `_browser_launch` (`scripts/lib/acg/cdp.sh`) launched system `/Applications/Google Chrome.app`; every ACG node script then `chromium.connectOverCDP`ed to it. System Chrome auto-updated independently and drifted past the pinned Playwright's DevTools-protocol support — observed Chrome 150 vs Playwright 1.60 (→ Chromium 148) failing `browserType.connectOverCDP: Protocol error (Browser.setDownloadBehavior): Browser context management is not supported`, dead-ending BOTH `make credential-test PROVIDER=aws` and the `make up` ACG path before the headless gate ran. **Empirically proven this session:** upgrading Playwright to 1.61.1 did NOT durably fix it (same failure — Chrome updates again); launching Playwright's own version-locked Chromium (`require('playwright').chromium.executablePath()` → `…/ms-playwright/chromium-1223/chrome-mac-arm64/Google Chrome for Testing.app/...`, confirmed EXISTS) and connecting over CDP returned `CONNECT_OK contexts=1`. **Implemented `e136f55ea39ea590c5ddccfa9fa4d064c42f4402`** (`fix(acg): launch Playwright-managed Chromium for CDP instead of system Chrome`), pushed to `origin/feat/v0.4.2`. Scope held exactly to the 3 listed files: `scripts/lib/acg/cdp.sh` now resolves the binary via `require('playwright').chromium.executablePath()` and hard-fails with an `npm install` message if absent (NO system-Chrome fallback), all 3 `cdp.sh` profile defaults now use `…/k3d-manager/pw-profile`, and `scripts/lib/acg/playwright/lib/output.js` `AUTH_DIR` now matches `pw-profile`. Gates passed: `shellcheck -S warning scripts/lib/acg/cdp.sh`, `npm run check`, `npm test`, sourcing probe `bash -c 'source scripts/lib/acg/cdp.sh; declare -f _browser_launch >/dev/null'`, and negative grep confirmed no `open -a "Google Chrome"` or `/Applications/Google Chrome.app` remained in `cdp.sh`. **USER acceptance gate (not Codex):** quit any stale system Chrome on `:9222`, then `make credential-test PROVIDER=aws` must launch Chrome-for-Testing, sign in headlessly, and extract creds before any subtree-pull.

**v0.4.1 SHIPPED — PR #33 merged to main (`b7c849c`, 2026-07-06T02:56Z).** Headless Pluralsight auto-login + non-interactive fast-fail for unattended AWS-sandbox provisioning. Post-merge done: main synced, **TAGGED v0.4.1** (annotated tag at merge `b7c849c`; GitHub release published), `feat/v0.4.2` cut from the merge SHA, retro `docs/retro/2026-07-06-v0.4.1-retrospective.md` written, CHANGE.md `[Unreleased]` → `## [v0.4.1] — 2026-07-06`. No branch protection on main → no enforce_admins to restore. Standing docs current (change is JS-internal + a 9-line `cdp.sh` cred-load; no new public shell functions → `docs/api/functions.md` unaffected). Copilot round on PR #33: 4 findings, 3 fixed + 1 declined-with-evidence (`browser.close()` kept; `Browser.disconnect()` does not exist in Playwright 1.60.0) — triage `docs/issues/2026-07-05-copilot-pr33-review-findings.md`. **Downstream:** k3d-manager subtree-pull of v0.4.1 into `scripts/lib/foundation/` now unblocked (tag exists) — DONE (merge `67b466db`). **v0.4.2 BUG FILED (2026-07-06):** the v0.4.1 headless gate `_cdp_ensure_acg_session`→`acg_session_check.js`→`loginWithPage` shipped but is **never called** in any production path — `_browser_launch` only ensures CDP Chrome is up, not that Pluralsight is signed in. `make up`'s only sign-in (`sandbox.js:handleSignIn`) relies on Google Password Manager autofill, which can't fire in the `--password-store=basic` dedicated profile → no sign-in / no sandbox / no AWS env → CloudFormation `InvalidClientTokenId`. **Fix (spec `docs/bugs/2026-07-06-acg-session-gate-not-wired-into-browser-launch.md`):** call `_cdp_ensure_acg_session` on both `_browser_launch` paths; reuses tested v0.4.1 code, preserves fast-fail + `K3DM_ACG_SKIP_SESSION_CHECK` opt-out; no JS change. **IMPLEMENTED `96bea46`** (pushed `origin/feat/v0.4.2`; cdp.sh + acg_cdp.bats + CHANGE.md; shellcheck clean, 3 BATS cases). **v0.4.2 BUG #2 COMPLETE (Codex, 2026-07-06) — credential-test path now reuses the same gate and avoids the locked-profile fallback:** spec `docs/bugs/2026-07-06-acg-session-gate-not-wired-into-credential-test.md` implemented as commit **`36c3bb16ee832f09223693f59d25aa57c9ab0210`** (`fix(acg): wire _cdp_ensure_acg_session into acg-credential-test + guard connectBrowser CDP fallback`), pushed to `origin/feat/v0.4.2`. Scope held exactly to the 3 listed files: `scripts/lib/acg/bin/acg-credential-test` now sources `cdp.sh` and calls `_cdp_ensure_acg_session` after the CDP-alive check; `scripts/lib/acg/playwright/lib/browser.js` now throws a clear error instead of attempting `launchPersistentContext` when CDP is reachable but exposes no usable context; `CHANGE.md` `[Unreleased]` gained the required `### Fixed` entry. Required gates passed: `shellcheck -S warning scripts/lib/acg/bin/acg-credential-test`, `npm run check`, `npm test`, and the sourcing probe `bash -c 'source scripts/lib/acg/cdp.sh; declare -f _cdp_ensure_acg_session >/dev/null'` exited 0. **Acceptance gate remains user-run only:** `make credential-test PROVIDER=aws` in lib-foundation must be exercised by the operator before any subtree-pull or downstream claim. **Follow-up:** correct latent no-op `disconnect()` idiom in `gcp_login.js:157`.

## Current State: `feat/v0.4.1` (as of 2026-06-22)

**v0.4.0 SHIPPED — PR #32 merged to main (`aed8c56`, 2026-06-23T01:14Z).** lib-acg absorbed as optional module `scripts/lib/acg/` (9 commits, 44 files). Post-merge done: main fast-forwarded, `feat/v0.4.1` cut from merge SHA, retro `docs/retro/2026-06-22-v0.4.0-retrospective.md` written. **TAGGED v0.4.0** (`647408a` on feat/v0.4.1 split `[Unreleased]` → `## [v0.4.0]` + back-filled `## [v0.3.19]`; tag at merge `aed8c56`; GitHub release published). Drift resolved: tag v0.3.19 (`45040e2`) had been cut with no section; v0.3.18 + v0.3.20 never existed as tags. No branch protection on main → no enforce_admins to restore. Standing docs current (`copilot-instructions.md` has acg; acg API in `docs/api/acg.md`). **Next:** Phase 2 = rewire k3d-manager (scoping now); pre-existing `_sts_valid` bug + agy-cli/Antigravity CDP retarget tracked. History below.

**feat/v0.4.0 — Phase 1 follow-up + regression fix complete (`cf3ad7a`, 2026-06-22)** — absorb lib-acg into lib-foundation as optional module `scripts/lib/acg/`. REGRESSION FIX (`cf3ad7a`): `e6cecef`'s repo-root `bin/` hoist broke the live `make credential-test PROVIDER=aws` Playwright sandbox-delete flow ("Element is outside of the viewport"). A byte-for-byte lib-acg copy experiment isolated the cause — both layouts resolve `REPO_ROOT` to the same absolute path, so the only runtime difference is the **working directory at launch** (repo root vs `scripts/lib/acg`). Reverted: `bin/` is module-local again (`scripts/lib/acg/bin/`, `REPO_ROOT=".."`), Makefile `cd`s into the module first, CI shellcheck override dropped, `.gitignore` added (node_modules/, test-results/). **Live `make credential-test PROVIDER=aws` PASSED**; PR pending. Phase 0 done (lib-acg `v0.1.9` tagged; migration source SHA `7708ae31`). Decisions locked: v0.4.0 / clean tree-copy / `npm ci`. Spec: `docs/plans/v0.4.0-phase1-import-acg-module.md` (overview: `v0.4.0-absorb-lib-acg.md`). Phase 1 follow-up delivered: `scripts/lib/acg/playwright.config.js` imported, `bin/acg-credential-test` + `bin/acg-extend-test` moved to repo-root `bin/`, root `Makefile` added, `REPO_ROOT` repointed to `../scripts/lib/acg`, `acg` CI shellcheck path fixed, and docs/CHANGE updated. Validation passed (`npm ci`, `npm run check`, `npm test`, `shellcheck -S warning bin/acg-credential-test bin/acg-extend-test`, `make help`, `make lint`, `make test`, `git diff --check`). The first Playwright run hit a sandbox-only `EPERM` mkdir on `scripts/lib/acg/test-results`; the rerun with elevated access passed and is recorded in `docs/issues/2026-06-22-lib-foundation-playwright-test-results-permission.md`. Phase 2 = rewire k3d-manager; Phase 3 = archive lib-acg.

## v0.3.18 Open Items

- [x] **Bugfix: `_copilot_auth_check` K3DM_ENABLE_AI gate** — DONE (`f0e29d9`, `eede5c3`). Spec: `docs/plans/v0.3.18-bugfix-copilot-auth-preflight.md`. Removed `K3DM_ENABLE_AI` gate; checks env tokens → `~/.config/github-copilot/apps.json` → `gh auth status`; clear error on failure. New `scripts/tests/lib/copilot_auth.bats` (6 tests).
- [ ] **Copilot review non-interactive permissions** — OPEN. `docs/issues/2026-05-02-copilot-review-noninteractive-permissions.md`. `_copilot_review` still emits a non-interactive Copilot call without the CLI permission mode the help text describes as required.

- [x] `rigor-cli` — repo bootstrapped (commit `a1c034f`), bash 3.2 fix (`8ae57bc`), gist installer (`310fd16`); lib-foundation spec: `docs/plans/v0.3.10-rigor-cli-init.md`; rigor-cli specs tracked in that repo (`plans/v0.1.1-mapfile-compat.md`, `plans/v0.1.1-gist-install-script.md`).
- [x] **v0.3.12: Antigravity helpers** — commit `ae0e8b9` adds `_ensure_antigravity_ide`, `_ensure_antigravity_mcp_playwright`, `_antigravity_browser_ready` per `docs/plans/v0.3.12-ensure-antigravity.md`.
- [x] **v0.3.13: antigravity browser probe fix** — commit `9350ecd` switches `_antigravity_browser_ready` to `_run_command --soft -- curl` per `docs/plans/v0.3.13-antigravity-browser-ready-fix.md`.
- [x] **v0.3.14: k3d-manager Copilot PR #51 deferred findings** — `e52b819` fixes all 5 upstream gaps per `docs/plans/v0.3.14-copilot-pr51-deferred-fixes.md`:
  - `_ensure_antigravity_ide` now detects `agy` binaries first
  - `_antigravity_browser_ready` fails fast when `curl` missing
  - `_agent_audit` tab scan iterates staged files via NUL-delimited loop
  - `docs/api/functions.md` explains `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_VERSION` pinned MCP default
  - `CHANGE.md` versions the v0.3.12/v0.3.13 release notes
- [ ] `shopping-carts` as consumer (future)

## Key Contracts (must not change without coordinating all consumers)

- `_run_command [--prefer-sudo|--require-sudo|--interactive-sudo|--probe '<subcmd>'|--quiet|--soft] -- <cmd>`
- `_detect_platform` → `mac | wsl | debian | redhat | linux`
- `_cluster_provider` → `k3d | k3s | orbstack`
- `_resolve_script_dir` → absolute canonical path of calling script's real directory
- `_DCRS_PROVIDER` — global temp set by `_deploy_cluster_resolve_provider` (no command substitution — preserves TTY)
- `_RCRS_RUNNER` — global temp set by `_run_command_resolve_sudo`

## Consumers

| Repo | Integration | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `k3d-manager` | git subtree at `scripts/lib/foundation/` | subtree pull to v0.3.13 pending |
| `rigor-cli` | git subtree at `scripts/lib/foundation/` | subtree pull to v0.3.13 pending |
| `shopping-carts` | git subtree (planned) | future |

## Engineering Protocol

- **Tests**: always run with `env -i PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin" HOME="$HOME" TMPDIR="$TMPDIR" bash --norc --noprofile -c 'bats scripts/tests/lib/'`
- **shellcheck**: run on every touched `.sh` file before commit
- **No bare sudo**: always `_run_command --interactive-sudo` for install helpers, `--prefer-sudo` for non-interactive
- **All changes originate here** — never edit consumer subtree copies directly
- **Release flow**: PR → merge → tag → GitHub release → consumers run `git subtree pull`

## Lessons Learned

- `local -n` nameref requires bash 4.3+ — use global temp vars (`_RCRS_RUNNER`, `_DCRS_PROVIDER`) for output from helpers
- Command substitution `$()` creates a subshell — `[[ -t 0 && -t 1 ]]` is always false inside; use global temp vars instead
- `--prefer-sudo` silently drops to non-root when password sudo required — use `--interactive-sudo` for install helpers
- `git subtree add --squash` creates a merge commit that blocks GitHub rebase-merge — use squash-merge with admin override in consumers
- BATS must run with `env -i` — ambient `SCRIPT_DIR` causes false passes
